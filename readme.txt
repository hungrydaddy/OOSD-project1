Modified from the skeleton code provided from the project pack.

For now, the map is made up of “Basic Terrain” and “Basic Object”. This feature could be later extended. One single “Basic Terrain” can be either solid (unable to move on) or not solid, can hold one “Basic Object”. The player is a “Basic Object”. A stone is supposed to be, but in this case, as the specs required, it needs to act like a non-solid “Basic Terrain”, and therefore certain modifications applied.
