#100% done by Minghao Huang, 813072.\
\
Modified from the skeleton code provided from the project pack.\
\
For now, the map is made up of \'93Basic Terrain\'94 and \'93Basic Object\'94. This feature could be later extended. One single \'93Basic Terrain\'94 can be either solid (unable to move on) or not solid, can hold one \'93Basic Object\'94. The player is a \'93Basic Object\'94. A stone is supposed to be, but in this case, as the specs required, it needs to act like a non-solid \'93Basic Terrain\'94, and therefore certain modifications applied.\
